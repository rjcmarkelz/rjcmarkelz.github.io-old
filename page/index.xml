I use data, mathematical models, and illustrations as tools to understand the beauty and complexity of nature.
Currently, I am an Accenture Global Environmental Change Fellow at Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS) working at the intersection between invasive species, climate change and wildfire in Californian ecosystems. My project involves developing probabilistic models that work with newly collated datasets and meta-data to work across environmental scales to understand wildfire spread and impact.</description></item><item><title>CV</title><link>https://rjcmarkelz.github.io/page/cv/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Apr 2021 02:13:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rjcmarkelz.github.io/page/cv/</guid><description>Current Affiliation Accenture Global Environmental Change Fellow- Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS) 2021-present Previous Affiliations Co-Founder and VP of Genomics Rev Genomics 2016-20 NSF Postdoctoral Fellow - UC Davis Department of Plant Biology 2014-17 UC Davis Data Science Initiative 2016-17 Education Ph.D. Plant Biology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign - 2012 Advisor: Dr. Andrew Leakey B.S.
