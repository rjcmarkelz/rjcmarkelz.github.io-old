I use data and mathematical models as tools to understand the beauty and complexity of nature. Currently, I am an Accenture Global Environmental Change Fellow at Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS) working at the intersection between invasive species, climate change and wildfire in Californian ecosystems.</description></item><item><title>CV</title><link>https://rjcmarkelz.github.io/page/cv/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Apr 2021 02:13:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rjcmarkelz.github.io/page/cv/</guid><description>Current Affiliation Accenture Global Environmental Change Fellow- Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS) 2021-present Previous Affiliations Co-Founder and VP of Genomics Rev Genomics 2016-20 NSF Postdoctoral Fellow - UC Davis Department of Plant Biology 2014-17 UC Davis Data Science Initiative 2016-17 Education Ph.D. Plant Biology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign - 2012 Advisor: Dr. Andrew Leakey B.S.
