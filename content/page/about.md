I am generally interested in the complexities of interactions in nature and choose problems that require (at least) a paper and pencil to work out. I use data and mathematical models as tools to understand the beauty and complexity of nature. Currently, I am an Accenture Global Environmental Change Fellow at [Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS)](https://bids.berkeley.edu/) working at the intersection between invasive species, climate change and wildfire in Californian ecosystems. My project involves developing probabilistic models that work with newly collated datasets and meta-data to work across environmental scales to understand wildfire spread and impact. During my graduate work as an NSF GRFP, I studied the effects of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide and water availability on plant carbon and nitrogen metabolism. I then blended this eco-physio-genomics training with computational and quantitative genetics to build genetically informed growth models of *Brassica rapa* and *Arabidopsis thaliana* as part of an NSF postdoc fellowship at UC Davis. After my fellowship, I co-founded and was the VP of Genomics at [Rev Genomics](https://www.revgenomics.com/) until the end of 2020. Rev Genomics uses genomics, statistics, molecular genetics, and tissue culture to create new strains of Cannabis for the legal market. Rev Genomics is funded by Y-Combinator among many notable venture capital firms and continues to innovate in the Cannabis biotech space. When not behind the command-line in my current role at BIDS, I can be found exploring California’s extensive backcountry on foot, bicycle, or skis and documenting my adventures through illustration, photos or prose.
