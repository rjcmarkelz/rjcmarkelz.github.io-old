## Dr. Sharon B. Gray Memorial Foundation
"I feel that when the human race acquired the technology and evolved the intelligence necessary to build an industrial society, it also acquired the moral obligation to understand and monitor its impact on the rest of the world." -Dr. Sharon B. Gray

Dr. Sharon Gray was a bright human being with a passion for science and mentoring women. This foundation has set up endowments for financially supporting women in science at UC Davis, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, American Society of Plant Biology, and the Ethiopian Agricultural Research Center (EIAR). To date, 37 scientists have recieved research or travel funding through the foundation. Read more about the projects [here](https://sharongrayfoundation.org/projects).


## Open Cannabis SNP Map Dataset
As part of my work at Rev Genomics, I analyzed and generated a dataset of 23500+ SNP and 2200+ InDel molecular markers from 1358 cultivars of Cannabis to aid in open-source breeding projects. The project contains data and tutorial on how to view and use the data using open-source tools. The data and tutorial are licensed under [Creative Commons Attributions License 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode) and can be downloaded directly [here (500MB)](http://future-cannabis.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/RevGenomicsOpenCannabisSNPData_v1_1_1.zip). An accompanying article was published on the Future Cannabis Project [Blog](http://futurecannabisproject.org/2019/09/rev-genomics-snp-map-analysis-open-cannabis-project-data-phylos-galaxy/).



## Plants iView High-Throughput Phenotyping, Raspberry Pi, Computer Vision
A new module for Plants iView emphasizing quantitative biology and experimental design for 7th graders. Students set up Raspberry Pi Camera rigs to take time-lapse photos of Arabidopsis plants growing in control or drought conditions. Learning the basics of computer vision and plotting students were able to interpret the plant growth data to see if their hypotheses were supported. It was great working with Jennifer Quebedeaux on this module.

## Art Science Hack v2.0
Vegetative Mass Media hackathon project for human interaction with plant growth models and exploration of high-dimensional model space. The user can play with the inherent trade-offs that plants face while growing such as allocating resources to above or below ground components. We hope you enjoy this concept science art made in < 48 hours. Code [here](http://github.com/rjcmarkelz/artsciencehack).

### Participants

## Art Science Hack v1.0
This is a new project that I am starting with some friends in Chicago. The idea is to get scientists and artists together in hackathon style weekends to create art in small groups. For more details on our test run check out the post [here](/ArtScienceHack/).

## Plants iView
I led a group of Illinois Plant Biology graduate students in creating middle school plant science curriculum to fit into an afterschool program at Urbana Middle School. As a group we wrote two successful grants to secure funding from the [ASPB Educational Foundation Grant](http://my.aspb.org/?page=EF_ProgramsResources) and the [Illinois Public Engagement Grant](http://engagement.illinois.edu/) for this project. This platform is still in use as a major outreach project for the Illinois Department of Plant Biology. All of the course materials, teacher discussion forum, and student blogs can be accessed through the [Plants iView website](https://plantsiview.igb.illinois.edu/lessons). We made sure that the lessons met national and Illinois specific educational standards for grades 6-8. The graduate students then taught all the lessons for the program.

## Art of Science 2.0
I worked with a visual artist to modify and display some confocal images I had taken as part of a PhD project. They were displayed at Indi-go gallery in Champaign, IL before traveling to a few spots around Illinois. The image I am standing next to is on display in the [Beckman Institute's Center for Nutrition, Learning, and Memory](http://www.cnlm.illinois.edu/). Captions are included for a pop-sci audience.

##### Arabidopsis thaliana live mitochondria and chloroplasts- Spinning disk confocal and Imaris 3D visualization

	<figcaption>This image shows leaf chloroplasts in light blue and mitochondria of different size classes on a scale from small (yellow) to large (brown). Mitochondria are dynamic cellular organelles that react very quickly to changes in the cellular environment by clumping together or dispersing throughout the cell in response to changes in light availability, leaf temperature, and the concentration of compounds produced by photosynthesis in the chloroplasts.  We are trying to understand how new mitochondria are made in leaf cells in response to climate change factors such as elevated [CO2]. This research has implications for accurate prediction of future food supply and ecosystem function in response to a changing climate.         </figcaption>

I am quantifying what happens to leaf mitochondria and chloroplast size/shape/number when plants are grown under elevated carbon dioxide concentrations expected for the end of this century. An understanding of these fundamental cellular responses are important for accurately predicting ecosystem function and global food supply in the face of climate change.   </figcaption>

## National Pollinator Week
For 2010 and 2011, I co-organized this community event with a fellow graduate student [Michelle Duennes](https://maduennes.wordpress.com/), A.K.A the __Polly Nator__! For the month leading up to National Pollinator Week Michelle and I worked a booth at the Urbana Farmers Market discussing the importance of pollinators for food production.

At the end of National Pollinator Week we hosted all day events that included:

*    Nature walks led by [The Prairie Monk](http://prairiemonk.org/index.html)
*    Insect photography workshop by Scientific American Blogger [Alex Wild](http://www.alexanderwild.com/)
*    Honey Tastings
*    Nurturing native bee workshop
*    Native bee identification workshop
*    Live concert by [Duke of Uke and His Novelty Orchestra](https://www.facebook.com/dukeofukemusic)
