### PhD Dissertation Projects

During graduate school I was interested in doing a mixture of field, molecular, computational, and engineering projects. Thanks in part to the freedom afforded by a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, I designed research projects to answer open questions in the climate change literature that incorporated these four components. Here is a copy of ![my dissertation](/static/pdfs/Markelz_PhD_Dissertation_2012.pdf).


### Abstract
The balance between photosynthetic carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) assimilation and respiratory CO<sub>2</sub> release influence plant growth, crop yields, and the ability of terrestrial ecosystems to offset ~2-3 Gt CO<sub>2</sub> yr -1 of anthropogenic emissions. Rising atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration ([CO<sub>2</sub>]) this century will impact plant photosynthesis and respiration with consequences for plant productivity in natural and agro-ecosystems. The capacity of all plants to grow and ecosystems to store carbon in elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] can be dependent on interactions with water,  nutrients, and plant developmental processes. The purpose of this thesis is to address fundamental knowledge gaps in understanding plant responses to the interaction between elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] with water, nitrogen (N), and leaf developmental programs: (1) determine what is the mechanistic response of maize C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis to a three way interaction between atmospheric [CO<sub>2</sub>], N availability and drought utilizing the unique capabilities of a Free Air CO<sub>2</sub> Enrichment (FACE) field experiment; (2) determine the transcriptional reprogramming of leaf respiration in response to growth in elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] and variable N supply using *Arabidopsis thaliana* and a custom built gas exchange system; (3) determine when in leaf development the transcriptional reprogramming of respiration occurs in response to elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] by studying the detailed developmental timelines and molecular events of leaf growth in *A. thaliana*. The knowledge gaps addressed in this work will help inform crop improvement and models that predict future ecosystem function and global food supply in the face of a changing climate.
